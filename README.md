# Portfolio videos

The plan is to make my own personal video library here and use it under my domain.

I just want to see what it's like to create a video library. I use React and TypeScript and Node.js.

I'm not sure if I'll add a separate backend, but for now I'm just building the frontend, and putting all the video
related data into a JSON. Perhaps I'll try hosting videos Cloudflare's R2 bucket.

I plan to use GSAP for animations, but keep other styles as close to my portfolio site and blog as possible.

update-videos-json.mjs file is used to check the videos and thumbnails that are stored inside the public folder to see if they match with the json data. Used only in local testing and development.

command:

node update-videos-json.mjs
