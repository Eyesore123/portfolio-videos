# Portfolio videos

The plan is to make my own personal video library here and use it under my domain.

I just want to see what it's like to create a video library. I use React and TypeScript and Node.js.

I'm not sure if I'll add a separate backend, but for now I'm just building the frontend, and putting all the video
related data into a JSON. Perhaps I'll try hosting videos on bunny.net.

I plan to use GSAP for animations, but keep other styles as close to my portfolio site and blog as possible.

update-videos-json.mjs file is used to check the videos and thumbnails that are stored inside the public folder.

command:

node update-videos-json.mjs
